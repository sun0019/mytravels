      <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I
        went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were
        there!</p>
      <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
      <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right
        away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful
        picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking
        <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

      <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
      <p>On our second day, we went shopping on
        <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was 
        dressed in the height of fashion.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!
          We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris
          and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we
          finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>

      <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
      <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's
      huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of
      Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was
      surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those
      by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
